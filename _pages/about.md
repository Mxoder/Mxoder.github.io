<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a graduate of the School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE) at Beihang University (北京航空航天大学计算机学院). My research is centered on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with a current focus on enhancing the coding capabilities of LLMs. I am also passionate about exploring Data Curation methodologies and the potential of Small Models.

I am a passionate advocate for open-source and take pride in contributing to the community with a variety of projects, models, and datasets on GitHub and Hugging Face. It is also my pleasure to give back to the academic world by serving as a reviewer for international conferences and workshops.

I find great joy in connecting with others and sharing knowledge through my technical blog. If my work resonates with you or if you have any ideas to discuss, I would be delighted to hear from you. You can find my email on the left.

[Math-PUMA: Progressive Upward Multimodal Alignment to Enhance Mathematical Reasoning](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/34815)

Wenwen Zhuang\*, Xin Huang\*, **Xiantao Zhang\***, Jin Zeng

[**Project**](https://github.com/wwzhuang01/Math-PUMA) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='OpcS2vQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C'></span></strong>
- This paper introduces Math-PUMA, a novel training methodology that uses Progressive Upward Multimodal Alignment to significantly narrow the performance gap between textual and visual modalities in mathematical reasoning , achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs.

[The Escalator Problem: Identifying Implicit Motion Blindness in AI for Accessibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07989)

**Xiantao Zhang**

- This paper identifies "Implicit Motion Blindness" in MLLMs, exemplified by their failure to determine an escalator's direction , and argues this flaw—caused by the prevalent frame-sampling paradigm —necessitates a paradigm shift from semantic recognition to robust physical perception to build trustworthy assistive AI for the visually impaired.

[Preservation vs. Fabrication: An Ethical Framework of Consent, Transparency, and Integrity for Posthumous AI Art](https://openreview.net/forum?id=UEHmz3m7zl)

**Xiantao Zhang**

- This paper proposes an ethical framework for posthumous AI art, demanding the artist's explicit consent, mandatory transparency, and an integrity rule that forbids AI from fabricating new works where no verifiable intent exists.
